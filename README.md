# Static This

This is a very simple node module that is installed globally and can be used to quickly start a static-web server for any directory. 

Simple use-cases that come to mind: 

- Rapid preview of an in-development website
- Show web files, such as JS and CSS, directly in the web-browser without needing to show the file:// protocol with the complete path to that file
- View technical documentation that may be in HTML format, such as javadocs

### Installation and usage
```
npm install -g 
```
